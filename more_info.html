                        In 1983, Jim Carrey dated singer Linda Ronstadt for eight months. Carrey has
                        been married twice. His first marriage was to former actress and Comedy
                        Store waitress Melissa Womer, whom he married on 28 March 1987. Their
                        daughter, Jane Erin Carrey, was born 6 September 1987. Jane was a 2012
                        contestant on American Idol. Carrey and Womer divorced in 1995.

                        On 23 September 1996, Carrey married his Dumb and Dumber co-star Lauren
                        Holly; the marriage lasted less than a year. From 1999 to 2000, Carrey was
                        engaged to his Me, Myself and Irene co-star Renée Zellweger. January Jones
                        was in a relationship with Carrey in 2002. Carrey met model and actress
                        Jenny McCarthy in 2005 and made their relationship public in June 2006. In
                        April 2010, the two ended their relationship. In October 2010, McCarthy said
                        they remained good friends.

                        Carrey met Cathriona White in 2012, a makeup artist from County Tipperary,
                        Ireland. They dated between 2012 and 2015. On 28 September 2015, White was
                        found dead from a prescription drug overdose; the death was ruled a suicide
                        by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. Carrey was a pallbearer at her
                        funeral in Cappawhite, County Tipperary, Ireland. Carrey attended the Golden
                        Globes 2019 Party with his girlfriend Ginger Gonzaga in January 2019. The
                        couple split after less than a year of dating.

                <h1>Wrongful death lawsuits</h1>
                <div class="article2_indhold">
                    <p>
                        Carrey's girlfriend Cathriona White married Mark Burton in 2013, in Las
                        Vegas. She had been dating Carrey on and off since 2012, and was still
                        married but dating Carrey when she died in 2015. On 19 September 2016,
                        Burton filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey, claiming that he had
                        used his "immense wealth and celebrity status" to illegally obtain and
                        distribute prescription drugs involved in White's death. Carrey released a
                        statement the following day:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What a terrible shame. It would be easy for me to get in a back room with
                        this man's lawyer and make this go away, but there are some moments in life
                        when you have to stand up and defend your honor against the evil in this
                        world. I will not tolerate this heartless attempt to exploit me or the woman
                        I loved. Cat's troubles were born long before I met her and sadly her tragic
                        end was beyond anyone's control. I really hope that some day soon people
                        will stop trying to profit from this and let her rest in peace.

                    <p>
                        In October 2016, White's mother, Brigid Sweetman, also filed a wrongful
                        death lawsuit against Carrey. In this suit, Sweetman's attorney states that
                        Carrey underwent a test for sexually transmitted infections, tested positive
                        for hepatitis A, HSV (Herpes) I and II, and chlamydia, and hid the results
                        from White and had unprotected sex with her. Sweetman later issued a
                        statement: "These documents show that Jim Carrey has lied to the media, the
                        public and the court. Carrey has now been shown for what he is—a dishonest
                        Hollywood celebrity who thinks he can say anything and fool people just
                        because he is famous." Both lawsuits were dismissed on January 25, 2018, and
                        attorneys for both sides confirmed there would be no further legal
                        proceedings.

                <h1>Vaccine skepticism</h1>
                <div class="article3_indhold">
                    <p>
                        In 2009, Carrey wrote an article questioning the merits of vaccination for
                        The Huffington Post. With former partner Jenny McCarthy, Carrey led a "Green
                        Our Vaccines" march in Washington, D.C., to advocate for the removal of
                        "toxic substances" from children's vaccines, out of a belief that children
                        had received "too many vaccines, too soon, many of which are toxic". The
                        rally was criticized by David Gorski, an American surgical oncologist on
                        Science-Based Medicine blog, for being anti-vaccine and not "pro-safe
                        vaccine", and by Steven Parker on the WebMD website for being
                        "irresponsible".

                    <p>
                        On July 1, 2015, after the signing of a new vaccination law, Carrey called
                        California Governor Jerry Brown a "corporate fascist" who was "poisoning"
                        children by enacting the vaccination requirements. The law disallowed
                        religious and philosophical reasons for exemption from vaccination. Carrey
                        was criticized for being "ignorant when it comes to vaccines" by Arthur
                        Caplan, head of the Division of Medical Ethics, at New York University, and
                        by Jeffrey Kluger, senior writer at Time, who described his anti-vaccination
                        statements as "angry, dense and immune to reason".

                        Carrey is an outspoken advocate of the "law of attraction". In an interview
                        with Oprah Winfrey on 17 February 1997, he revealed that as a struggling
                        actor he would use visualization techniques to get work. He also stated that
                        he visualized a $10 million check given to him for "acting services
                        rendered", placed the check in his pocket, and seven years later received a
                        $10 million check for his role in Dumb and Dumber. Carrey practices
                        Transcendental Meditation. Carrey has defended socialism and has urged the
                        Democratic Party to embrace the movement, saying "We have to say yes to
                        socialism, to the word and everything. We have to stop apologizing".

                    <p>
                        Carrey has shared his own political cartoon drawings since August 2017,
                        including controversial renderings of then-White House Press Secretary Sarah
                        Huckabee Sanders and then-President Donald Trump. He sparked an
                        international event on 31 March 2019, posting a drawing criticising fascism
                        by depicting Benito Mussolini's infamous death with Clara Petacci; this
                        irked Mussolini's granddaughter Alessandra who chided him on Twitter calling
                        him "a bastard" and his artworks "dirty paper." His drawing repertoire
                        culminated in an exhibition titled IndigNation, which opened on 23 October
                        2018 at the Maccarone Gallery in Los Angeles and featured 108 pen-and-ink
                        drawings from Carrey's Twitter feed from 2016 to 2018.
