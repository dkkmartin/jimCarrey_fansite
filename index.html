                        James Eugene Carrey born January 17, 1962 is a Canadian-American actor,
                        comedian and artist. Known for his energetic slapstick performances, Carrey
                        first gained recognition in 1990, after landing a role in the American
                        sketch comedy television series In Living Color (1990–1994). He broke out as
                        a star in motion pictures with Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask and Dumb
                        and Dumber (all 1994). This was followed up with Ace Ventura: When Nature
                        Calls, Batman Forever (both 1995) and Liar Liar (1997).

                        In the 2000s, he gained further notice for his portrayal of the Grinch in
                        How the Grinch Stole Christmas and for the comedy Me, Myself & Irene (both
                        in 2000), as well as Bruce Almighty (2003), Lemony Snicket's A Series of
                        Unfortunate Events (2004), Fun with Dick and Jane (2005), Yes Man, Horton
                        Hears a Who! (both 2008), and A Christmas Carol (2009). In the 2010s, Carrey
                        appeared in the films Mr. Popper's Penguins (2011), The Incredible Burt
                        Wonderstone, Kick-Ass 2 (both 2013), Dumb and Dumber To (2014), and
                        portrayed Leap Day William in the sitcom 30 Rock (2012). In 2020, he
                        portrayed Dr. Robotnik in Sonic the Hedgehog and its 2022 sequel and Joe
                        Biden in six episodes of Saturday Night Live in the leadup to the 2020
                        United States presidential election.

                <h2>Early life</h2>
                <div class="article2_indhold">
                    <p>
                        Carrey was born in the Toronto suburb of Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, to
                        Kathleen (née Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, a musician and
                        accountant. He was raised a Roman Catholic and has three older siblings,
                        John, Patricia, and Rita. His mother was of French, Irish, and Scottish
                        descent, and his father was of French-Canadian ancestry; the family's
                        original surname was Carré. At age eight, he began making faces before a
                        mirror and discovered a talent for doing impressions. At age ten, Carrey
                        wrote a letter to Carol Burnett of the Carol Burnett Show pointing out that
                        he was already a master of impressions and should be considered for a role
                        on the show; he was overjoyed when he received a form letter reply.

                        A fan of Monty Python, whose TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus aired in
                        the 1970s, in 2014 Carrey appeared on Monty Python's Best Bits (Mostly) and
                        recalled the effect on him of Ernest Scribbler (played by Michael Palin)
                        laughing himself to death in "The Funniest Joke in the World" sketch. Radio
                        Times states, "You'll see why immediately: Palin's performance is uncannily
                        Carreyesque."

                <h2>Career</h2>

                    <p>
                        Carrey's first stand-up comedy experience took place in 1977 at the age of
                        15 with his father trying to help him put together a stage act, driving him
                        to downtown Toronto to debut at the recently-opened Yuk Yuk's comedy club
                        operating one-night-a-week out of community centre The 519's basement on
                        Church Street. For the performance, Carrey had his attire—a polyester
                        leisure suit—chosen by his mother who reasoned "that's how they dress on The
                        Dean Martin Celebrity Roast". Pubescent Carrey's conventional impersonations
                        bombed, proving ill-suited for a club with a raunchy comedic sensibility and
                        giving him doubts about his potential as a professional entertainer. Decades
                        later, recalling Carrey's stand-up debut, Yuk Yuk's owner Mark Breslin
                        described it as "bad Rich Little". His family's financial struggles made it
                        difficult for them to support Carrey's show business ambitions.

                <h2>1983-1994: Move to Hollywood</h2>
                <div class="article4_indhold">
                    <p>
                        In early 1983, Carrey decided to move to Hollywood where he began regularly
                        performing at The Comedy Store. Getting on The Tonight Show became his
                        immediate career goal, and, by spring 1983, he appeared to have achieved it
                        after getting booked for a stand-up set on the highly-rated late night show.
                        However, a lukewarm club set at The Improv got him unbooked. Though
                        struggling to replicate his success in Los Angeles, Carrey continued being a
                        big hit in his hometown Toronto where he returned during late April 1983 to
                        perform at the short-lived B.B.

                        Magoon's theatrical venue on Bloor Street on three consecutive nights. While
                        in town, CTV's flagship newsmagazine program W5 did a feature on Carrey that
                        aired nationally in Canada. Back in L.A., within months, he landed the main
                        role on The Duck Factory, a sitcom being developed for NBC, and, in late
                        November 1983, still got to debut his impressionist act on The Tonight Show
                        Starring Johnny Carson via a promotional appearance for the sitcom about to
                        start airing nationally in the United States on the same network. In the
                        meantime, he was cast for a supporting role in the Warner Bros. comedy
                        production Finders Keepers, shot in the Canadian province of Alberta during
                        late summer 1983.

                    For his Tonight Show appearance that aired on American Thanksgiving, 21-year-old
                    Carrey went through his most popular impressions—Elvis Presley, Leonid Brezhnev,
                    Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, Michael Landon,
                    James Dean, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Charles Nelson Reilly, characters from
                    My Three Sons, and Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy—in rapid succession. After
                    completing his set, though getting the OK gesture from Carson, the impressionist
                    comic was notably not waved over by the host to join him on the couch—a usual
                    indication that while sufficiently pleased, the powerful host was probably not
                    ecstatic about the performance. The end of 1983 saw Carrey go back home to
                    Toronto once more for a publicized New Years' Eve performance at the Royal York
                    Hotel's Imperial Room.
